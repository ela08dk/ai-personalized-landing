            <p>This Customer Terms of Service is entered into by and between Newmode ("Newmode") and the entity or person placing an order for or accessing any Services ("Customer" or "you"). If you are accessing or using the Services on behalf of your company, you represent that you are authorized to accept this Agreement on behalf of your company, and all references to "you" or "Customer" reference your company.

            <p>This Agreement permits Customer to purchase subscriptions to online software-as-a-service products and other services from Newmode pursuant to any Newmode ordering documents, online registration, order descriptions or order confirmations referencing this Agreement ("Order Form(s)") and sets forth the basic terms and conditions under which those products and services will be delivered.</p>

            <p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: THAT SECTION 11.5 OF THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A DISPUTE RESOLUTION CLAUSE THAT REQUIRES MOST DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE RESOLVED THROUGH THE COURTS OF ENGLAND AND WALES. SEE SECTION 11 FOR MORE INFORMATION.</strong></p>

            <p>Customer represents and warrants that it has all necessary rights to provide Customer Data to Newmode and grant the licenses herein, and that Customer Data does not infringe third-party rights or contain malicious code.</p>
            <p>Customer is solely responsible for the accuracy, quality, integrity, and legality of Customer Data and for obtaining any necessary consents for its collection and use.</p>
            <p>Newmode will process Customer Data as a data processor under UK GDPR and in accordance with Customer's instructions as set forth in this Agreement or Order Forms. Newmode will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Customer Data.</p>
            <p>Newmode may use aggregated, de-identified data derived from Customer Data ("Usage Data") for its business purposes, such as improving the Services, provided it does not identify Customer or any individual.</p>
            <p>Upon request during the Subscription Term, Newmode will make Customer Data available for export. After termination, Newmode may delete Customer Data in accordance with its retention policies.</p>

            <p>If availability falls below this, Customer may be eligible for service credits as specified in the Order Form (for paid Services only). This is Customer's sole remedy for downtime.</p>
            <p>For Free Services, support and availability commitments do not apply.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-craftera-dark mt-8 mb-4">6. Fees and Payment</h2>

            <p>Overdue payments accrue interest at the rate of 8% per annum above the Bank of England base rate from time to time in force, calculated on a daily basis from the due date until the date of actual payment, whether before or after judgment.</p>
            <p>Newmode may suspend Services if payments are overdue by more than 30 days, after notice.</p>
            <p>Newmode may adjust Fees for renewals by providing at least 60 days' notice.</p>
            <p>For Free Services, no Fees apply, but Newmode may convert to paid or discontinue at any time.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-craftera-dark mt-8 mb-4">7. Taxes</h2>

            <p>Newmode's aggregate liability under this Agreement will not exceed the Fees paid by Customer in the 12 months preceding the claim.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-craftera-dark mt-8 mb-4">10. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>Customer will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Newmode, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from: (a) Customer Data; (b) Customer's use of Services in violation of this Agreement or laws; (c) Customer's products or services; or (d) gross negligence or willful misconduct.</p>
            <p>Newmode will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Customer from any claims that the Services infringe a third party's intellectual property rights. If Services become subject to such a claim, Newmode may procure the right to continue use, replace or modify, or terminate and refund prepaid Fees. This does not apply if infringement arises from Customer modifications, combination with non-Newmode products, or use after notice to discontinue.</p>
            <p>The indemnified party will provide prompt notice of claims, cooperate in defense, and allow the indemnifying party to control defense and settlement (provided no settlement admits liability or imposes obligations without consent).</p>
            <p>This Section states the exclusive remedy for IP claims.</p>
